## tRack

A reprository built to automatically track and graph the Barro Colorado Island climate data. The reprository automatically downloads and extracts BCI climate data from the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute website](http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/physical_monitoring/research/barrocolorado), and graphs it below.

It is build on a test-driven platform, and uses a makefile to initiate webscraping, analysis and graphing. It has a refresh rate of once a month. This github version will however be updated less frequently as I intend to maintain this manually.
